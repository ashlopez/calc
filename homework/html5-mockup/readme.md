#Mockup to HTML Homework

##Learning Objectives

+ Practice conceptually breaking apart a design into modern HTML5 elements.

+ Practice using all we've learned with CSS so far to style and lay out a website



We learned a lot today about HTML structure, modern HTML5 elements, CSS styling, and keeping our presentation and content layers as separate as we can!

The goal for this homework is to get practice with allllllll of this, so your mission is to take this mockup and build as close a replica as you can using HTML & CSS, keeping our presentation and content as clear and readable as possible.

There are sliced up images if you need them in the images folder. See how much you can figure out how to do without them, and use them when you need to!

Good luck, come ask questions during Office Hours if you need help!
