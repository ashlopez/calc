# Git & Github Review

## Learning Objective(s)
* Students will recall the basic workflow of using git with github
* Students will practice making their own repositories, and pushing & pulling changes

#### Git/Github Review:
* Intro and talk about how we are going to review the Git commands we learned last week (```git add, commit, push, clone, pull, status, init```).

###### Git Some Exercise
Then we're gonna break into groups of 4, and work on sprucing up a page together.

-  Whoever's all the way to the left is the starter – you get to make repo on your account. Get it started, gather an html & css file, and invite your teammembers as collaborators.
- Then it's the next person's turn – they're in charge of starting to style. Think of it like a game of telephone, each person's allowed to make one change, commit & push, and pass it on to the next.
- Work on it together, and use what you've learned so far with CSS to make a decent looking page. Add content if you want, but have something nice, and work together to have a rich history for your mini-exercise.
